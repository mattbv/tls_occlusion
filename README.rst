tlseparation
============

This is a library aimed at perfoming automated material separation from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point cloud data.

The list of functions available is still growing, with different approaches for pre-processing, classifying and filtering still being added.

This is still a work in progress, requiring some polishing to improve user-friendliness, but the core modules are sound and tested.

Over the following weeks, more documentation will be added to help users to perform the automated separation or use the individual modules/functions in different workflows.

The tlseparation library is being developed as part of my PhD research, supervised by Dr. Mat Disney, in the Department of Geography at University College London (UCL). My research 
is funded through Science Without Borders from the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (10.13039/501100003593) â€“ Brazil (Process number 233849/2014-9).
